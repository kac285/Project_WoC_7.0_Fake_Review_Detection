Best Feedback for Havells Instanio Prime 25 L“The Havells Instanio Prime 25-Litre Storage Water Heater is an excellent addition to my home. Its sleek design and vibrant color-changing LED indicator make it both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The 25-liter capacity is perfect for our family, providing enough hot water for showers and kitchen needs without running out.The heating is incredibly fast, and the high-density PUF insulation ensures the water stays warm for hours, saving on energy costs. I especially appreciate the Feroglas technology that keeps the tank durable and corrosion-free.The safety features, including the multi-function valve and protective anode rod, give me peace of mind. It’s easy to use, energy-efficient, and well-built. Havells has truly combined style, technology, and reliability in this water heater. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a premium geyser with great performance!”
